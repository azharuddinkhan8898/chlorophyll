            We set along without any paths to follow<br>

            There were times when the glass of wine overflowed<br>
            And times when on empty glasses we got high!<br><br>
            The moments of joy, the moments of pain<br>
            Have all become part of what we will be known by<br><br>

            All became Destiny as the days went by"

            was a graduate of the JJ School of Arts from Mumbai, and a co-founder of
            chlorophyll in 1999.<br>
            Before he started chlorophyll, he had worked as a Creative Director in the finest
            advertising agencies winning over 100 of the national and international awards.
            At chlorophyll, he invented the concept of ideantityTM, which is essentially an
            identity with a visual idea within it. The ideantityTM lives up to
            Malcolm Gladwell’s observation that customers make most buying decisions
            and the best choices by relying on their two-second first impressions or their
            ‘adaptive unconscious’. In his 17 years of untiring work at chlorophyll, Nalesh
            Patil created over 60 published ideantitiesTM: this is probably the highest
            number of ideantitiesTM by any designer worldwide.
            Nalesh’s second very fertile career was that of a nature poet. He wrote over 100
            poems in his mother tongue, Marathi, and sang them, in his untutored but
            unforgettable voice, at over 120 locations in Maharashtra and Punjab, two states
            of India. In June 2018, a book of his poetry titled ‘Hirve Bhaan’
            (it loosely translates to ‘Green Consciousness') was published posthumously.

            Here is a translation of the poem he wrote for
            chlorophyll’s 15th anniversary. The poem uses
            the analogy of a rainbow to explain the teamwork
